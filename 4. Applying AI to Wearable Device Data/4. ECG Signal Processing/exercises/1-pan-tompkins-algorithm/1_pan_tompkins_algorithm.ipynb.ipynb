    "\n",
    "We will start with the same algorithm that you saw in the last video. This starter code differs only in that we do not *LocalizeMaxima* on the output peaks. This is because for this dataset the QRS complexes could be pointing up or down and if we try to find the maxima when the QRS complex is pointing downward we will hurt our algorithm performance. Instead we will be happy with the approximate QRS locations that our algorithm detects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current version of the algorithm has a precision and recall of 0.89 and 0.74. Verify this by running the next cell. Your task is to improve the performance of the algorithm by adding the following features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Refractory Period Blanking\n",
    "Recall from the physiology lesson that the QRS complex is a result of ventricular depolarization, and that cellular depolarization happens when ions travel across the cell membrane. There is a physiological constraint on how soon consecutive depolarization can occur. This constraint is 200 ms. Read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractory_period_(physiology)#Cardiac_refractory_period). We can take advantage of this phenomenon in our algorithm by removing detections that occur within 200ms of another one. Preserve the larger detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adaptive Thresholding\n",
    "The QRS complex height can change over time as contact with the electrodes changes or shifts. Instead of using a fixed threshold, we should use one that changes over time. Make the detection threshold 70% of the average peak height for the last 8 peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### T-Wave Discrimination\n",
    "One error mode is to detect T-waves as QRS complexes. We can avoid picking T-waves by doing the following:\n",
    "  * Find peaks that follow a previous one by 360ms or less\n",
    "  * Compute the maximum absolute slope within 60ms of each peak. Eg `np.max(np.abs(np.diff(ecg[peak - 60ms: peak + 60ms])))`\n",
    "  * If the slope of the second peak is less than half of the slope of the first peak, discard the second peak as a T-wave\n",
    "Read another description of this technique [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan%E2%80%93Tompkins_algorithm#T_wave_discrimination)\n",
    "\n",
    "After implementing these three techniques you should see a significant increase in precision and recall. I ended up with 0.95 and 0.87. See if you can beat that! "
