    "As with activity classification, we will featurize our time series signal and throw those features into a classifier. For AF we will build a two-class classifier using the inter-beat-interval time series. This time series can be derived by taking the difference between successive QRS complex locations as provided by the Pan-Tompkins algorithm in the previous videos. We source our features from a couple submissions to the [Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2017/1.0.0/). \n",
