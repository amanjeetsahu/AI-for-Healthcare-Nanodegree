    "In this exercise you will estimate pulse rate using the PPG signal in the time domain. In the video lesson we saw an example of how to estimate pulse rate using the frequency domain and this method was necessary because that PPG waveform was corrupted by motion. The PPG segment you will be provided for this exercise was collected at rest, so it is possible to see the heart beats in the time-domain as below:\n",

    "Your task is to find the peaks using the [`scipy.signal.find_peaks`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.find_peaks.html) function. To be successful at this task you will need to call the `find_peaks` with appropriate arguments, so you will need to experiment and read the documentation."
